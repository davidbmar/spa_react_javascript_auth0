In this mock prototype:

The uploadToS3 function is defined to handle the S3 signed URL upload. It takes the file blob, desired filename, bucket name, and upload URL as parameters.
The generateFilename function generates a unique filename based on the current timestamp. You can modify this function to generate filenames according to your preferred format.
The handleUpload function is called when the upload button is clicked. It retrieves the selected file, upload URL, bucket name, and generates a filename. It then calls the uploadToS3 function to initiate the file upload.
The HTML markup includes input fields for the upload URL and bucket name, a file input field to select the audio file, and an upload button.
The script tag contains the necessary JavaScript code to handle the file upload functionality.
To test this functionality, you can open the HTML file in a web browser. Enter the appropriate upload URL and bucket name, select an audio file, and click the "Upload to S3" button. The file will be uploaded to the specified S3 bucket using the generated filename.

Note: Make sure to replace the placeholder upload URL and bucket name with your actual S3 signed URL endpoint and bucket name.

Remember to handle any necessary authentication or authorization mechanisms required by your S3 setup.
